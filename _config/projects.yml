      through [Blueprint](http://calblueprint.org), a student organization I am
      a part of, that uses technology for social good. Soon to be launched at
      [beta.re-volv.org](http://beta.re-volv.org).

      An Android application for working with resistor values.
      It's simple, small, and user-friendly. This was my first mobile project, as
      well as my first Java project.  The app is free on the Google Play Store.

  #   description: >
  #       A growing Berkeley tutoring startup that I worked on in Fall 2013.
  #       As Lead Engineer, I developed the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) backend
  #       for the site. Some tools I used include [Heroku](http://heroku.com/),
  #       [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/), and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/).
  #       I played a significant role in front-end development as well, working on
  #       responsive design and form validation. Uguru is now part of the
  #       [500 Startups](http://500.co/ugurume) accelerator.

  #   description: >
  #       My hack for Camp Hackathona at Facebook during Summer 2013. The idea
  #       is simple: bump phones with another person and be thrown to their Facebook.
  #       We made this before Apple added NFC to their phones, so instead we use
  #       accelerometers to determine a "bump", and then MongoDB's geospatial
  #       queries to determine which two phones bumped. We built both an HTML5 app and a
  #       standalone iOS application.
