#Hi {.page-header}

My name is Aleks. I'm an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) 
major at the University of California, Berkeley. This past summer, I returned
to [Facebook](http://fb.me/ayk), where I worked on the Machine
Translation team within Language Technology. My project involved monitoring and
analyzing Out-of-Vocabularies (OOVs) and building an interface to help
understand and eliminate them. Besides working on my 
[personal projects]({{ site.url }}/projects), I love discovering all kinds of 
[new music](http://www.rdio.com/people/AleksKamko/), and perusing through 
various style blogs. You can check out my resume [here]({{ site.url }}/resume). 
And please don't hesitate to contact me via [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or 
by means of any of the links in the header; I'm always open to talk!

#About the site {.page-header}

My site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a awesome static blog 
generator that makes creating your own site a walk in the park. But, just in 
case, I've written up a detailed blog post [here]({{ page.base_url }}blog) 
about how you can build your *own* Jekyll site (it's a lot easier than you 
might think). My site is hosted for free, using the amazing Github Pages 
service from Github. The repo for this entire site can be found 
[here](https://github.com/aykamko/aykamko.github.io), along with detailed 
documentation that goes along with the 
[previously mentioned blog post]({{ page.base_url }}blog).
